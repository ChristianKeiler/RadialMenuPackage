RadialMenu
===

RadialMenu is an Editor and UI Extension for creating Radial Menu Elements.
The package contains a Radial Layout Group as well as a Radial Menu Component.

## Usage

To create a Radial Menu simply click the RadialMenu button on your Unity Menubar and select 'Radial Menu'. A new window will open which lets you chose how many elements you want on your menu.
If you need to add a new Item later on you can do so by clicking the 'Add Item' button on the RadialMenu component. If you want to delete an item simply delete it in the hierarchy and the menu will update itself accordingly.

You may also just create a circular layout with a certain radius. To do so you can add the RadialLayoutGroup component to your GameObject.
